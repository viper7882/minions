Now synthesize the findings from multiple junior workers (LLMs). 
Your task is to finalize an answer to the question below **if and only if** you have sufficient, reliable information. 
Otherwise, you must request additional work.

---
## Inputs
1. Question to answer:
{question}

2. Collected Job Outputs (from junior models):
{extractions}

---
First think step-by-step and then answer the question using the exact format below.

## ANSWER GUIDELINES
1. **Determine if the collected Job Outputs provide enough trustworthy, consistent evidence to confidently answer the question.** 
   - If the data is incomplete or contradictory, do NOT guess. Instead, specify what is missing.
   - If the evidence is sufficient, provide a final answer.

2. **Be conservative.** When in doubt, ask for more information.

3. **Address conflicts.** If multiple jobs give different answers, rely on whichever is best supported by a valid "explanation" and "citation".
   - If you need more information from the conflicting jobs, specify which job IDs need further investigation.
   - Describe what specific information you need from those jobs.

4. **Required JSON Output**: You must output a JSON object with these keys:
   - "decision": Must be either "provide_final_answer" OR "request_additional_info"
     - Use "provide_final_answer" if you have enough information
     - Use "request_additional_info" if you cannot conclusively answer
   - "explanation": A short statement about how you arrived at your conclusion or what is still missing
   - "answer": The final answer string if "decision"="provide_final_answer", or null otherwise
   - "feedback": If decision="request_additional_info", provide clear instructions on what information is still needed. Be specific about:
     - What type of information to look for
     - Which sections or parts of the document to focus on
     - What criteria or details are important
     DO NOT include any code or programming instructions in this field.
   - "scratchpad": Notes on information gathered so far
     
Here is the template for your JSON response (with no extra text outside the JSON):

<think step-by-step here>
```json
{{
"decision": "…",
"explanation": "…",
"answer": "… or null", # Good answer format: "0.56"; Bad answer format: "The ratio is calculated as 1-0.27*2 = 0.56"
"feedback": "… or null", # No code in this field.
"scratchpad": "… or null"
}}
```

**Important**:
- Don't forget commas in the json object above^
- If there is not enough information, set "answer" to null, set "decision" to "request_additional_info"
- The feedback field should ONLY contain natural language instructions. DO NOT include any code, function definitions, or programming syntax.
- Focus on describing WHAT information is needed, not HOW to programmatically extract it.

Now, carefully inspect the question, think step-by-step and perform any calculations before outputting the JSON object."""

You do not have access to the raw document(s), but instead can assign tasks to small and less capable language models that can access chunks of the document(s).
Note that the document(s) can be very long, so each task should be performed only over a small chunk of text. 
The small language model can only access one chunk of the document(s) at a time, so do not assign tasks that require integration of information from multiple chunks.

Write a Python function that will output formatted tasks for a small language model.
Make sure that NONE of the tasks require multiple steps. Each task should be atomic! 
Consider using nested for-loops to apply a set of tasks to a set of chunks.
The same `task_id` should be applied to multiple chunks. DO NOT instantiate a new `task_id` for each combination of task and chunk.

You (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.

## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions

### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`
- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.
- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.
- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.
- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.
- In this round, limit yourself to **up to {num_tasks_per_round} tasks** total.
- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).

### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`
- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.
- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).
- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.
- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.

The following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**

## Function Signatures

## Chunking Function

## Important Reminders:
- **DO NOT** assign tasks that require reading multiple chunks or referencing entire documents.
- Keep tasks **chunk-local and atomic**.
- **You** (the supervisor) are responsible for aggregating and interpreting outputs in `transform_outputs()`. 

Now, please provide the code for `prepare_jobs()` and `transform_outputs()`.

DECOMPOSE_TASK_PROMPT_SHORT_JOB_OUTPUTS = """\
# Decomposition Round #{step_number}

Based on the previous job outputs, write a python function called (prepare_jobs) that delegates more tasks to small language models.
- assume access to the same chunking functions as before
- make sure that NONE of the tasks require multiple steps
- consider using nested for-loops to apply a set of tasks to a set of chunks
- The same `task_id` should be applied to multiple chunks. DO NOT instantiate a new `task_id` for each combination of task and chunk.

Additionally,
- You are provided access to the outputs of the previous jobs (see job_outputs). 
- If its helpful, you can append context from previous job outputs as `metadata` to new chunks. Here is sample code for that:

```
```
task_id = 1  # Unique identifier for the task
for doc_id, document in enumerate(context):
    # if you need to chunk the document into sections
    chunks = chunk_by_section(document)

    for chunk_id, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        # Create a task for extracting mentions of specific keywords
        task = (
            "Extract all mentions of the following keywords: "
            "'Ca19-9', 'tumor marker', 'September 2021', 'U/ml', 'Mrs. Anderson'."
        )
        job_manifest = JobManifest(
            chunk=chunk,
            task=task,
            advice="Focus on extracting the specific keywords related to Mrs. Anderson's tumor marker levels."
        )
        job_manifests.append(job_manifest)
```

REMOTE_SYNTHESIS_COT = """\
Now synthesize the findings from multiple junior workers (LLMs). 
Your task is to analyze the collected information and think step-by-step about whether we can answer the question.
Be brief and concise in your analysis.

## Previous Progress
{scratchpad}

## Inputs
1. Question to answer:
{question}

2. Collected Job Outputs (from junior models):
{extractions}

## Instructions
Think step-by-step about:
1. What information we have gathered
2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question
3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing
4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer
5. If there are conflicting answers:
--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.

Be brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \ before the $ sign).
